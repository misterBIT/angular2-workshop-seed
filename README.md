# Angular 2 QuickStart Source (simplified)

This repository holds the TypeScript source code of the [angular.io quickstart](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html),
the foundation for most of the documentation samples and potentially a good starting point for your application.

Some differences from the source at [angular/quickstart](https://github.com/angular/quickstart):
1. Testing and their dependencies were removed from this clone for simplification sake.
2. Added Some simple routing 
3. Sample CRUD module (without any fancy state solution)
4. Basic Chat room with Socket.io 


**This is not the perfect arrangement for your application. It is not designed for production.
It exists primarily to get you started quickly with learning and prototyping in Angular 2**

We are unlikely to accept suggestions about how to grow this QuickStart into something it is not.
Please keep that in mind before posting issues and PRs.

## Prerequisites

Node.js and npm are essential to Angular 2 development. 
    
<a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node" target="_blank" title="Installing Node.js and updating npm">
Get it now</a> if it's not already installed on your machine.
 
**Verify that you are running at least node `v5.x.x` and npm `3.x.x`**
by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in a terminal/console window.
Older versions produce errors.

We recommend [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) for managing multiple versions of node and npm.

## Create a new project based on the QuickStart

Download this repo or clone it into new project folder (e.g., `my-proj`).
```bash
git clone  https://github.com/angular/quickstart  my-proj
cd my-proj
```

if your have cloned, discard everything "git-like" by deleting the `.git` folder.
```bash
rm -rf .git  // non-Windows
rd .git /S/Q // windows
```

### Create a new git repo
You could [start writing code](#start-development) now and throw it all away when you're done.
If you'd rather preserve your work under source control, consider taking the following steps.

Initialize this project as a *local git repo* and make the first commit:
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

Create a *remote repository* for this project on the service of your choice.

Grab its address (e.g. *`https://github.com/<my-org>/my-proj.git`*) and push the *local repo* to the *remote*.
```bash
git remote add origin <repo-address>
git push -u origin master
```
## Install npm packages

> See npm and nvm version notes above

Install the npm packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

**Attention Windows Developers:  You must run all of these commands in administrator mode**.

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

> If the `typings` folder doesn't show up after `npm install` please install them manually with:

> `npm run typings -- install`

The `npm start` command first compiles the application, 
then simultaneously re-compiles and runs the `lite-server`.
Both the compiler and the server watch for file changes.

Shut it down manually with Ctrl-C.

You're ready to write your application.

### npm scripts

We've captured many of the most useful commands in npm scripts defined in the `package.json`:

* `npm start` - runs the compiler and a server at the same time, both in "watch mode".
* `npm run tsc` - runs the TypeScript compiler once.
* `npm run tsc:w` - runs the TypeScript compiler in watch mode; the process keeps running, awaiting changes to TypeScript files and re-compiling when it sees them.
* `npm run lite` - runs the [lite-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lite-server), a light-weight, static file server, written and maintained by
[John Papa](https://github.com/johnpapa) and
[Christopher Martin](https://github.com/cgmartin)
with excellent support for Angular apps that use routing.
* `npm run typings` - runs the typings tool.
* `npm run postinstall` - called by *npm* automatically *after* it successfully completes package installation. This script installs the TypeScript definition files this app requires.
